<p>I used Regex to solve this problem, and my choice of language is Java</p>
<p>test.html and test2.html are my test files, once the entire web page is parsed, the links are written to the files output.txt and output2.txt respectively</p>

<p>This solution has no library dependency, except FileUtils from Apache commons.io for testing purposes</p>
